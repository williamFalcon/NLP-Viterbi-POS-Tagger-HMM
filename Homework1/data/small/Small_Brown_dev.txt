He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .
The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear .
A century of exploration had established that a great land mass , North and South America , lay between Europe and the Indies .
One by one , the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded .
In fact , Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes .
But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap , far to the north .
Nearly twenty-five years before , Captain John Davis had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle , `` a very great gulf , the water whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting of tides '' .
He named this opening , between Baffin Island and Labrador , the `` Furious Overfall '' .
( Later , it was to be called Hudson Strait .
) In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .
Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway .
Even Hudson , experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was , must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames .
Ahead were perilous , ice-filled waters .
On previous voyages , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain .
On the second voyage , he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case .
On the third voyage , a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-Atlantic .
Worse , his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before .
Of only one could he be sure -- young John Hudson , his second son .
The mate , Robert Juet , who had kept the journal on the Half Moon , was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity .
Philip Staffe , the ship's carpenter , was a good worker , but perversely independent .
Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest -- lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis .
But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find .
Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer .
And he refused to be anything else .
